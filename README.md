# EarthHealth

## Project Status: Unfinished

**We’re Sorry!**

We regret to inform you that the **EarthHealth** project is currently not in the state we envisioned. Our initial goal was to create an innovative platform for analyzing and understanding the impact of greenhouse gases in our communities, especially as we aimed to compete in the NASA ISAC competition.

Unfortunately, due to time constraints and unforeseen challenges, our current version does not reflect our original vision. We had hoped to provide a robust and user-friendly application that would effectively engage users and facilitate awareness about greenhouse gas emissions, but we fell short of that goal.

### What Went Wrong

- **Limited Time**: We underestimated the time required for development and testing.
- **Resource Constraints**: Our team faced unexpected obstacles that hindered our progress.
- **Complexity of the Task**: The intricate nature of greenhouse gas analysis proved to be more challenging than anticipated.

### Current Features

Although the project is unfinished, we have managed to implement two functions:

- **Forum**: A basic forum for community discussions and engagement.
- **3D Globe**: A 3D globe visualization, allowing users to interact with the globe. However, it currently does not display any greenhouse gas data.

### Looking Ahead

While we are disappointed with our current progress, we are committed to improving this project. We recognize the importance of addressing greenhouse gas emissions and the role they play in our environment, and we hope to refine and complete this project in the future.
