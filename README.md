# EarthHealth

## Project Status: Unfinished

**We’re Sorry!**

We regret to inform you that the **EarthHealth** project is currently not in the state we envisioned. Our initial goal was to create an innovative platform for analyzing and understanding the impact of greenhouse gases in our communities, especially as we aimed to compete in the NASA ISAC competition.

Unfortunately, due to time constraints and unforeseen challenges, our current version does not reflect our original vision. We had hoped to provide a robust and user-friendly application that would effectively engage users and facilitate awareness about greenhouse gas emissions, but we fell short of that goal.

### What Went Wrong

- **Limited Time**: We underestimated the time required for development and testing.
- **Resource Constraints**: Our team faced unexpected obstacles that hindered our progress.
- **Complexity of the Task**: The intricate nature of greenhouse gas analysis proved to be more challenging than anticipated.

### Current Features

Although the project is unfinished, we have managed to implement two functions:

- **Forum**: A basic forum for community discussions and engagement.
- **3D Globe**: A 3D globe visualization, allowing users to interact with the globe. However, it currently does not display any greenhouse gas data.

### Commitment to Completion

We want to assure everyone that we are committed to working on the EarthHealth project until it is fully finished. Our goal is to develop a fully functional application that meets the needs of researchers and the community, effectively conveying the importance of understanding greenhouse gas emissions. We believe that with further development, our app could potentially earn a second chance in the eyes of NASA subject matter experts.
